    "text": "Course Description\nThis is an introductory course on using Python, a free and versatile programming language, to analyze text data. The course begins by building foundational programming skills in Python, including working with variables, loops, conditional statements, and data structures like lists, dictionaries, and arrays. In the second part, students will explore Python’s powerful tools for analyzing text data, such as social media posts, email correspondence, customer reviews, and political debates. The course also includes an introduction to ChatGPT and prompt engineering, teaching students how to leverage large language models for advanced text analysis tasks.\nThrough hands-on exercises, lectures, and projects, students will learn to process, clean, and analyze textual data systematically and reproducibly. By the end of the course, participants will be equipped with the skills to derive meaningful insights from textual information and integrate generative AI tools like ChatGPT into their workflows.\nNote: You should have a computer either Windows or Mac with at least 8GB of RAM memory.",
