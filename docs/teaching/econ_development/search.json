    "text": "Course Description\nThis course examines the dynamic relationship between technological innovation and social transformation, emphasizing the ways in which technology both shapes and is influenced by institutions and societal structures. Drawing on theoretical perspectives and debates in political science and economics, we will address three central questions: 1) How does technological change affect social organization and economic development? 2) Why do technological advances so often fail to produce equitable outcomes? 3) To what extent can technological trajectories be guided or governed? Students will engage critically with the political, economic, and ethical dimensions of technological change, evaluating how societies might direct innovation toward more inclusive, just, and sustainable forms of development.",

They will test the improvement of students’ knowledge of the theories and facts developed in the course, and independent critical thinking. Both the mid-term and final exams represent 33% of the grade.\nA major exam (midterm or final) cannot be made up without the permission of the Dean’s Office. The Dean’s Office will grant such permission only when the absence was caused by a serious impediment, such as a documented illness, hospitalization or death in the immediate family (in which you must attend the funeral) or other situations of similar gravity. Absences due to other meaningful conflicts, such as job interviews, family celebrations, travel difficulties, student misunderstandings or personal convenience, will not be excused. Students who will be absent from a major exam must notify the Dean’s Office prior to that exam. Absences from class due to the observance of a religious holiday will normally be excused. Individual students who will have to miss class to observe a religious holiday should notify the instructor by the end of the Add/Drop period to make prior arrangements for making up any work that will be missed.",

Use visual aids (e.g., slides) effectively, ensuring text is legible and visuals are relevant. Practice beforehand to stay within the time limit and maintain a confident, professional tone. Be prepared to answer 2-3 questions from peers or the instructor during and after the presentation. Remember to cite your sources and avoid reading verbatim from slides or notes.\nIn addition to summarizing the key arguments or findings, your presentation should include critical analysis of the material. Highlight what the author does not address, the limitations of their research, or potential problems in their analysis or methodology. Think about how the research could be improved, expanded, or connected to broader themes discussed in class, and incorporate these insights into your presentation.\nYou can find below an example of a good presentation together with an explanation for why it is good:\n\nPresentation",
