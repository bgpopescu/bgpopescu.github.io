Drawing on theoretical perspectives and debates in political science and economics, we will address three central questions: 1) How does technological change affect social organization and economic development? 2) Why do technological advances so often fail to produce equitable outcomes? 3) To what extent can technological trajectories be guided or governed? Students will engage critically with the political, economic, and ethical dimensions of technological change, evaluating how societies might direct innovation toward more inclusive, just, and sustainable forms of development.\n\n## Learning Outcomes\n\nUpon successful completion of this course the students will be able to:\n\n- Explain key concepts and theories linking technological change to social, political, and economic development.\n- Compare major theoretical perspectives on how technology shapes institutions, inequality, and growth.\n- Apply course theories to real-world cases, assessing the social and political consequences of specific technologies.\n- Critically evaluate empirical claims about technological change, identifying assumptions, evidence, and limitations.\n- Communicate clear, well-structured arguments about technology and development in written exams, oral presentations, and class discussion.\n\n## Textbook and/or Resource Materials\n\nNo textbook required\n\n\n## Assessment\n\nThere are three components to the final grade for this class:\n\n- Contributions to Class 33%\n- Mid-term 33%\n- Final exam 33%\n\n\n**Contributions to Class**\n\nThe contributions to class are the average of:\n\n- presentation\n- physical presence\n- class participation\n- questions submitted every week\n- quality of questions\n\n\n\nThe mid-term and final exams are closed-book. They will test the improvement of students' knowledge of the theories and facts developed in the course, and independent critical thinking. Both the mid-term and final exams represent 33% of the grade.\n\nA major exam (midterm or final) cannot be made up without the permission of the Dean’s Office. The Dean’s Office will grant such permission only when the absence was caused by a serious impediment, such as a documented illness, hospitalization or death in the immediate family (in which you must attend the funeral) or other situations of similar gravity. Absences due to other meaningful conflicts, such as job interviews, family celebrations, travel difficulties, student misunderstandings or personal convenience, will not be excused. Students who will be absent from a major exam must notify the Dean’s Office prior to that exam. Absences from class due to the observance of a religious holiday will normally be excused. Individual students who will have to miss class to observe a religious holiday should notify the instructor by the end of the Add/Drop period to make prior arrangements for making up any work that will be missed.\n\n## Presentations\n\nEach student will deliver a 15 minute presentation on a topic assigned in advance. Presentations should include a clear introduction, main points, and conclusion. Use visual aids (e.g., slides) effectively, ensuring text is legible and visuals are relevant. Practice beforehand to stay within the time limit and maintain a confident, professional tone. Be prepared to answer 2-3 questions from peers or the instructor during and after the presentation. Remember to cite your sources and avoid reading verbatim from slides or notes. \n\nIn addition to summarizing the key arguments or findings, your presentation should include critical analysis of the material. Highlight what the author does not address, the limitations of their research, or potential problems in their analysis or methodology. Think about how the research could be improved, expanded, or connected to broader themes discussed in class, and incorporate these insights into your presentation.\n\n\nYou can find below an example of a good presentation together with an explanation for why it is good:\n\n-   [Presentation](/lecture1/academic_presentation.html){target=\"_blank\"}\\\n\n## Rubric for Presentations\n\n| **Criteria**                    | **Weak**                                                                           | **Points** | **Satisfactory**                                                                                              | **Points** | **Strong**                                                                                                                                | **Points** |\n|----------|----------|----------|------------|----------|------------|----------|\n| **Content Knowledge**           | Limited understanding of the reading, may not accurately summarize key points.           | 10         | Adequate understanding of the reading, provides a basic summary of key points.                                | 20         | Comprehensive understanding of the reading, presents a nuanced and detailed summary of key points.                                        | 29         |\n| **Critical Analysis**           | Fails to offer meaningful analysis or insights.

Students with more than three unexcused absences are assumed to have withdrawn from the course. Students with a justified reason not to attend class have to send me an email explaining why they cannot attend ahead of class.\n\n## Academic Honesty\n\nAs stated in the university catalog, any student who commits an act of academic dishonesty will receive a failing grade on the work in which the dishonesty occurred. In addition, acts of academic dishonesty, irrespective of the weight of the assignment, may result in the student receiving a failing grade in the course. Instances of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Dean of Academic Affairs. A student reported twice for academic dishonesty is subject to summary dismissal from the University. In such a case, the Academic Council will then make a recommendation to the President, who will make the final decision.\n\n## Students with Learning Diﬀiculties and other Disabilities\n\nThe University does not discriminate based on disability. Students with approved accommodations must inform their professors at the beginning of the term.

policy.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","number-sections":false,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
