    "text": "Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in Political Science at Tec de Monterrey in Mexico City. Previously, I taught at the University of Oxford and I was a postdoctoral researcher at Bocconi and Princeton. I received my PhD in Political Science from the University of Chicago.\nMy research and teaching focus on state-building in peripheral regions and its long-term legacies. I draw on archival research, computational methods, and quantitative analysis of observational and narrative evidence. My first book, Imperial Borderlands: Institutions and Legacies of the Habsburg Military Frontier (Cambridge University Press, 2024), examines how historical states adopted distinct institutions in border areas and traces their enduring consequences. My current research investigates the political control of information technologies in the Ottoman Empire and its implications for long-term development.\nMy research has been published in leading peer-reviewed journals, including Comparative Political Studies, Journal of Conflict Resolution, and Quarterly Journal of Political Science, among others. For more details, see my CV{target=“_blank”}."

A whole range of studies investigate the negative effect of Western extractivism, while more recent works indicate that extractivism can in fact be good. This book argues that these views are incomplete. The reason for these contrasting views is that both of these sides take the concept of extractive institutions as monolithic, omitting that extractive institutions could in fact entail a variety of dimensions including imperial investment, transformation of the local property rights regime, and coercion, which could directly impact development.\nI propose a conceptual framework for understanding the ambivalent effect of extractive institutions, which depends on the three factors: investment, property rights, and violence. The worst outcomes for development are cases of extractivism with low state investment in infrastructure, high transformation of local society by removing property rights, and high physical coercion. To substantiate these claims, this book draws from a diversity of historical and modern data sources, tracing the evolution of Habsburg Military Colonialism, an institution that the central state created in the 1500s over vast territories in Central and Eastern Europe.\nA book workshop took place on September 17, 2021.

    "text": "The Knowledge Trap: Printing, Schooling, and the Costs of Empire\n\nHow Absence of the Printed Word Limited Development\n\n\n\n\nMy second book examines how political control of information infrastructure can suppress human capital formation for centuries. Focusing on the Ottoman Empire’s restrictions on the printing press, I show how centralized censorship, religious gatekeeping over texts, and thin book markets created a “knowledge trap” - a self-reinforcing equilibrium of low literacy and weak demand for education that outlasted the empire itself. Using an original dataset capturing the duration of Ottoman rule across Southeastern Europe, the book reveals persistent literacy gaps along former imperial frontiers, even under shared national institutions. Evidence first published in Comparative Political Studies, suggests that longer Ottoman rule is associated with lower contemporary economic performance.\nRead the article (Winner of the James Caporaso Award for Best Article in CPS in 2022).\nThe book then asks when and how inherited deficits can be reversed, tracing divergent trajectories across Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Albania. The findings speak to broader debates in comparative politics: imperial legacies persist not mechanically but conditionally - they endure where weak state capacity coincides with populations misaligned with the successor regime, and they erode where administrative reach meets a society willing to be schooled. Regime type matters less than the direction of state capacity - whether it restricts or expands access to knowledge.\nA book workshop took place on February 14, 2025. Participants included Timur Kuran (Duke University), Carles Boix (Princeton University), Anna Grzymała-Busse (Stanford University), Keith Darden (American University), Agustina Paglayan (University of California, San Diego), Iza Ding (Northwestern University), Ahmet Kuru (San Diego State University), and Michael Driessen (John Cabot University).\n\nDownload the introduction and table of contents"
