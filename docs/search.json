    "text": "Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor (tenured) in Political Science at John Cabot University in Rome, Italy. Previously, I taught at the University of Oxford and I was a postdoctoral researcher at Bocconi and Princeton. I received my PhD in Political Science from the University of Chicago.\nMy research and teaching interests focus on state management in peripheral regions and their enduring ramifications. I draw on extensive archival research, and computational methods and employ quantitative analysis of observational data and narrative evidence. My first book – Imperial Borderlands: Institutions and Legacies of the Habsburg Military Frontier (Cambridge University Press, 2023), focuses on how historical states adopt distinct institutions in border areas and their long-term consequences. My second book, Islam, Sultans, and the Printing Press scrutinizes the historical disparities between the Middle East and the West. It specifically investigates the long-term legacies of the delay in the adoption of the printing press in the Ottoman Empire.\nMy research was published in leading peer-reviewed journals, including Comparative Political Studies, Journal of Conflict Resolution, and Quarterly Journal of Political Science, among others."

A whole range of studies investigate the negative effect of Western extractivism, while more recent works indicate that extractivism can in fact be good. This book argues that these views are incomplete. The reason for these contrasting views is that both of these sides take the concept of extractive institutions as monolithic, omitting that extractive institutions could in fact entail a variety of dimensions including imperial investment, transformation of the local property rights regime, and coercion, which could directly impact development.\nI propose a conceptual framework for understanding the ambivalent effect of extractive institutions, which depends on the three factors: investment, property rights, and violence. The worst outcomes for development are cases of extractivism with low state investment in infrastructure, high transformation of local society by removing property rights, and high physical coercion. To substantiate these claims, this book draws from a diversity of historical and modern data sources, tracing the evolution of Habsburg Military Colonialism, an institution that the central state created in the 1500s over vast territories in Central and Eastern Europe.\nA book workshop took place on September 17, 2021.
