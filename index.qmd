Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor (*tenured*) in Political Science at [John Cabot University](https://www.johncabot.edu/political-science-international-affairs/default.aspx){target="_blank"} in Rome, Italy. Previously, I taught at the [University of Oxford](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk){target="_blank"} and I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Bocconi](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/){target="_blank"} and [Princeton](https://politics.princeton.edu){target="_blank"}. I received my PhD in Political Science from the [University of Chicago](https://political-science.uchicago.edu){target="_blank"}.

My research and teaching interests focus on state management in peripheral regions and their enduring ramifications. I draw on extensive archival research, and computational methods and employ quantitative analysis of observational data and narrative evidence. My first book â€“ <em>Imperial Borderlands: Institutions and Legacies of the Habsburg Military Frontier</em> (<em>Cambridge University Press</em>, 2024), focuses on how historical states adopt distinct institutions in border areas and their long-term consequences. My second book, <em>Islam, Sultans, and the Printing Press</em> scrutinizes the historical disparities between the Middle East and the West. It specifically investigates the long-term legacies of the delay in the adoption of the printing press in the Ottoman Empire.

My research was published in leading peer-reviewed journals, including <em>Comparative Political Studies</em>, <em>Journal of Conflict Resolution</em>, and <em>Quarterly Journal of Political Science</em>, among others.
