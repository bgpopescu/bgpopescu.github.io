Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in Political Science at [Tec de Monterrey](https://research.tec.mx/vivo-tec/){target="_blank"} in Mexico City. Previously, I taught at the [University of Oxford](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk){target="_blank"} and I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Bocconi](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/){target="_blank"} and [Princeton](https://politics.princeton.edu){target="_blank"}. I received my PhD in Political Science from the [University of Chicago](https://political-science.uchicago.edu){target="_blank"}.

My research and teaching focus on state-building in peripheral regions and its long-term legacies. I draw on archival research, computational methods, and quantitative analysis of observational and narrative evidence. My first book, <em>Imperial Borderlands: Institutions and Legacies of the Habsburg Military Frontier</em> (<em>Cambridge University Press</em>, 2024), examines how historical states adopted distinct institutions in border areas and traces their enduring consequences. My current research investigates the political control of information technologies in the Ottoman Empire and its implications for long-term development.

My research has been published in leading peer-reviewed journals, including <em>Comparative Political Studies</em>, <em>Journal of Conflict Resolution</em>, and <em>Quarterly Journal of Political Science</em>, among others. For more details, see my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/optcr0vsvyxd4nv6yfl12/bogdan-popescu-cv.pdf?rlkey=l36m9959xuey04nsrlzrzz05r&dl=0){target="_blank"}.
