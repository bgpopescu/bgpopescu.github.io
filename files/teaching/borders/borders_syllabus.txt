2 Course Description
In recent times, the expansion of flows of people has been met by a proliferation of fortified borders. This course explores borders and boundaries’ meanings, rules, and consequences. The course aims to acquaint students with the study of border-making and the consequences of borders. Students will be exposed to various approaches describing the emergence of borders: philosophical, political economy, and sociological perspectives. It will delve into the inquiry of how both modern and historical borders were made and their long-term implications. The course will explore questions like:
	•	What are borders?
	•	How are international borders determined?
	•	How are borders adjudicated and maintained?
	•	How do international borders influence war and peace between states?
	•	How do borders affect international trade and development?
The course will examine various regional contexts, including Europe, Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the United States. By the course’s conclusion, students will be able to scrutinize diverse political outcomes through the lens of border-making.
3 Summary of Course Content
The course introduces students to interrelated topics: 1) the emergence of borders, 2) the relationship between borders and state sovereignty, and 3) how borders affect domestic and international politics. It explores how historical trajectories shape the delineation of borders globally, addressing questions such as the nature and origins of the borders, characteristics of borders, types of borders, their role in projecting symbolic and hard power, their effectiveness in containing populations, and their long-run consequences.
4 Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, the students will:
	•	have a comprehensive understanding of what constitutes “the border” and its historical origins
	•	analyze how historical paths and events have shaped the contemporary delineation of borders
	•	compare and contrast different countries and regions, including Europe, Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and the United States, regarding border-making and its impact on trade and migration
	•	recognize how historical legacies of border-making continue to shape patterns of political inclusion, nationalism, and ethnic politics
5 Assessment
You will be graded based on how well-prepared you come to class. During the first session, there will be primarily a lecture, while the second session will be dedicated to student presentations and a discussion. During the second session, students must demonstrate their knowledge of the readings and ability to engage in independent, critical thinking. References to current global issues will be a constant. Contributions to class discussion, especially during the second session, will represent 33% of the final grade.
There will be a mid-term in-class, closed-book exam, which will test the improvement of students’ knowledge of the theories and facts developed in the first half of the course. There will also be a final exam, which will be comprehensive of all topics covered in the course. The exam will test students’ knowledge and ability to engage in proactive, independent critical thinking. Both the mid-term and final exams represent 33% of the grade.
A major exam (midterm or final) cannot be made up without the permission of the Dean’s Office. The Dean’s Office will grant such permission only when the absence was caused by a serious impediment, such as a documented illness, hospitalization or death in the immediate family (in which you must attend the funeral) or other situations of similar gravity. Absences due to other meaningful conflicts, such as job interviews, family celebrations, travel difficulties, student misunderstandings or personal convenience, will not be excused. Students who will be absent from a major exam must notify the Dean’s Office prior to that exam. Absences from class due to the observance of a religious holiday will normally be excused. Individual students who will have to miss class to observe a religious holiday should notify the instructor by the end of the Add/Drop period to make prior arrangements for making up any work that will be missed.
5.1 Attendance
Students are required to attend classes following the University’s policies. Students with more than four unexcused absences (two weeks) are assumed to have withdrawn from the course. Thus, students must attend classes and all exams in person on campus (unless otherwise required by the University). Students with a justified need to participate in any exam remotely may do so only if express permission has been obtained from the Dean’s Oﬀice before the exam.
5.2 Students with Learning Diﬀiculties and other Disabilities
The University does not discriminate based on disability. Students with approved accommodations must inform their professors at the beginning of the term. Please see the website for the complete policy.
5.3 Required Books
There are no specific required book for the course. See the items for every specific week’s session.
5.4 Academic Honesty
As stated in the university catalog, any student who commits an act of academic dishonesty will receive a failing grade on the work in which the dishonesty occurred. In addition, acts of academic dishonesty, irrespective of the weight of the assignment, may result in the student receiving a failing grade in the course. Instances of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Dean of Academic Affairs. A student who is reported twice for academic dishonesty is subject to summary dismissal from the University. In such a case, the Academic Council will then make a recommendation to the President, who will make the final decision.
