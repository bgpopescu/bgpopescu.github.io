Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in Political Science at [John Cabot University](https://www.johncabot.edu/political-science-international-affairs/default.aspx){:target="_blank"} in Rome, Italy. Previously, I taught at the [University of Oxford](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk){:target="_blank"} and I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Bocconi](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/){:target="_blank"} and [Princeton](https://politics.princeton.edu){:target="_blank"}. I received my PhD in Political Science from the [University of Chicago](https://political-science.uchicago.edu){:target="_blank"}.

My research and teaching interests focus on how states manage their peripheries and their long-term implications. Most of my work focuses on Europe and examines how political elites respond to domestic and international threats, the policies they adopt, and their long-run repercussions. I draw on extensive archival, field research, and computational methods and employ quantitative analysis of observational data and narrative evidence. My new book with <em>Cambridge University Press</em> â€“ <em>Imperial Borderlands: Institutions and Legacies of the Habsburg Military Frontier</em>, focuses on how historical states adopted distinct institutions in border areas and their long-term consequences.

My research was published in leading peer-reviewed journals, including <em>Quarterly Journal of Political Science</em>, the <em>Journal of Conflict Resolution</em>, <em>Comparative Political Studies</em>, and <em>Journal of Historical Political Economy</em>.
